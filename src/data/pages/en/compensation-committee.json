                  "The company established the Remuneration Committee in 2011, and the Board of Directors formulated the 'Remuneration Committee Charter' to strengthen corporate governance and enhance the remuneration system for directors and managers. The committee meets at least twice a year and additionally as needed. The committee diligently performs its duties in good faith according to the law and submits recommendations to the Board for discussion. Additionally, the company arranges briefings on relevant laws and the current state of executive compensation to increase committee members' understanding of regulations and company operations. The Remuneration Committee assists the Board in implementing and evaluating overall compensation and benefits policies, as well as reviewing the remuneration for managers. The committee, composed of three independent directors, is responsible for reviewing compensation, performance, and salary adjustments, with policies and standards established in company guidelines and regulations."
