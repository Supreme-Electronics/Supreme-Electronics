                "In 2023, the total energy consumption across all business locations was 2,293.14 GJ, with purchased electricity accounting for the majority, and no renewable energy usage. The purchased electricity primarily powered office equipment, accounting for 89.08% of total consumption. The remaining 250.37 GJ (10.92%) was due to gasoline usage for official vehicles. The Taipei headquarters consumed 86.95% of the total energy, while the three smaller offices in Xinzhuang, Longtan, and Tainan combined accounted for only 13.05%. The 2023 energy consumption was higher than previous years, with an energy intensity of 1.08 GJ per NT$ billion, primarily due to increased personnel and server expansion to meet operational needs, leading to higher electricity usage. Additionally, as business interactions grew, the use of official vehicles increased, resulting in a rise in gasoline consumption."
