The total greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1 + Scope 2) amounted to 299.712 tons of CO2e, mainly from Scope 2 electricity emissions, accounting for 93.51%. The remaining greenhouse gas emissions came from Scope 1 sources, including company vehicle fuel usage, refrigerants, fire extinguishers, and septic tanks, accounting for 6.49%. Compared to 2022, there was a slight increase due to business growth and corresponding staff increase. To meet operational demands, the IT department expanded server hardware, resulting in increased electricity usage.","To understand the carbon emissions from upstream and downstream activities in the corporate value chain, a voluntary Scope 3 inventory was conducted. The aim is to identify the most significant emission sources through a comprehensive greenhouse gas inventory, providing fundamental data for greenhouse gas reduction and climate transition strategies. In 2023, Scope 3 emissions totaled 1,289.207 tons of CO2e, with sources including emissions from fuel and energy-related activities not covered in Scope 1 or 2, and indirect greenhouse gas emissions from transportation (including \'upstream and downstream transportation and distribution\' and \'business travel\'). Downstream transportation and distribution accounted for the largest share, at 69.51% of total Scope 3 emissions."]}},{"type":"Tab","props":{"categories":["Overview","Scope 1 & Scope 2","Scope 3"],"tabs":{"Overview":[{"type":"BarChart","props":{"xDataKey":"name","data":[{"name":"2021","uv":3.393,"pv":232.317,"type3":1500.392,"amt":0.259},{"name":"2022","uv":14.654,"pv":242.175,"type3":1723.624,"amt":0.326},{"name":"2023","uv":19.462,"pv":280.25,"type3":1289.207,"amt":0.465}],"series":[{"key":"uv","type":"bar","color":"#F8B195","yAxisId":"left","stackId":"a","name":"Scope 1"},{"key":"pv","type":"bar","color":"#F67280","yAxisId":"left","stackId":"a","name":"Scope 2"},{"key":"type3","type":"bar","color":"#C06C84","yAxisId":"left","stackId":"a","name":"Scope 3"},{"key":"amt","type":"line","color":"#355C7D","yAxisId":"right","name":"Emission Intensity"}],"yAxisLeftUnit":"Unit: tons CO2e","yAxisRightUnit":"Unit: tons CO2e / billion"}}],"Scope 1 & Scope 2":[{"type":"Table","props":{"unit":"Unit: tons CO2e","headers":["Category","2021","2022","2023"],"rows":[[{"content":"Scope 1: Direct Greenhouse Gas Emissions"},{"content":"3.393"},{"content":"14.654"},{"content":"19.462"}],[{"content":"Scope 2: Indirect Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Energy"},{"content":"232.317"},{"content":"242.175"},{"content":"280.250"}],[{"content":"Total Emissions"},{"content":"235.710"},{"content":"256.829"},{"content":"299.712"}],[{"content":"Greenhouse Gas Emission Intensity (tons CO2e / billion)"},{"content":"0.259"},{"content":"0.326"},{"content":"0.465"}]]}}],"Scope 3":[{"type":"Table","props":{"unit":"Unit: tons CO2e","headers":["Category","2021","2022","2023"],"rows":[[{"content":"Category 3: Emissions from Fuel and Energy-Related Activities (not included in Scope 1 or 2)"},{"content":"42.775"},{"content":"47.390"},{"content":"60.274"}],[{"content":"Category 4: Upstream Transportation and Distribution Emissions"},{"content":"(Note 4)"},{"content":"53.172"},{"content":"46.383"}],[{"content":"Category 6: Business Travel Emissions"},{"content":"225.242"},{"content":"306.120"},{"content":"286.470"}],[{"content":"Category 9: Downstream Transportation and Distribution Emissions"},{"content":"1,232.375"},{"content":"1,316.942"},{"content":"896.080"}],[{"content":"Total"},{"content":"1,500.392"},{"content":"1,723.624"},{"content":"1,289.207"}]]}}]}}}]}},{"type":"Section","props":{"background":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgxlmyje/image/upload/v1730624485/bg-greenhouse-gases_vqmzrr.webp","components":[{"type":"H1","props":{"text":"Reduction Action Plan"}},{"type":"H2","props":{"text":"Scope 1 and Scope 2"}},{"type":"IconGrid","props":{"steps":[{"title":"Implement Energy-Efficient Equipment","icon":"faBalanceScale"},{"title":"Encourage Energy-Efficient Equipment in Public Areas of Buildings","icon":"faLifeRing"},{"title":"Promote Public Transport or Carpooling","icon":"faGlobe"}]}},{"type":"H2","props":{"text":"Scope 3"}},{"type":"IconGrid","props":{"steps":[{"title":"Continue Seeking Opportunities in New Green Energy Industries","icon":"faBalanceScale"},{"title":"Collaborate with Transport Providers Offering Green Services","icon":"faLifeRing"},{"title":"Consider Procuring Green Electricity or Purchasing Green Certificates","icon":"faGlobe"},{"title":"Combine Product Exports for Reduced Transportation Frequency","icon":"faGlobe"}]}}]}},{"type":"Section","props":{"components":[{"type":"H1","props":{"text":"External Verification of Greenhouse Gas Inventory"}},{"type":"DocDownload","props":{"text":"2023 Greenhouse Gas Inventory Report","href":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zcmOHqjgoeu0Degoo4_fnMfTb_FmZFs8/view"}},{"type":"DocDownload","props":{"text":"2022 Greenhouse Gas Inventory Report","href":"http://www.supreme.com.tw/File/2022%E5%B9%B4%E6%BA%AB%E5%AE%A4%E6%B0%A3%E9%AB%94%E7%9B%A4%E6%9F%A5%E7%A2%BA%E4%BF%A1%E5%A0%B1%E5%91%8APwC.pdf"}},{"type":"DocDownload","props":{"text":"2021 Greenhouse Gas Inventory Report","href":"http://www.supreme.com.tw/File/2021%E5%B9%B4BSI%E8%81%B2%E6%98%8E%E6%9B%B8.pdf"}}]}}]}')}}]);
